using dynamic routing as all .md files can be in one 
folder (blog) rather than having to add a whole new folder,
I can just add a .md file and the server adjusts accordingly.

Dates must be in this format:

year-month-day (american way smh)
e.g. 06/05/2024 = 2024-05-06

Otherwise ordering of posts wont work with the
newest first.


Going to be using threlte to use 
3d as it has lots of documentation
and specifically designed for use with 
svelte.












below is code for three.js - working to get background animations or
things for hovering over the header give user feedback:


	import { browser } from '$app/environment'; 
	import * as THREE from "three"

	if(browser) {
		let camera : THREE.PerspectiveCamera;
		let scene : THREE.Scene;
		let renderer : THREE.WebGLRenderer;

		const init = () => {
      
			scene = new THREE.Scene();
			camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );

			renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
			//renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
      renderer.setSize( 400, 400)
			document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

			const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );
			const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0xffffff } );
		}

		const render = () => {
			renderer.clear()
			renderer.render(scene, camera);
		}

		const animate = () => {
			requestAnimationFrame(animate)
			//cube.rotation.x += 0.005

			render()
		}

		init()
		animate()
	}
