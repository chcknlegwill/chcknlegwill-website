using dynamic routing as all .md files can be in one 
folder (blog) rather than having to add a whole new folder,
I can just add a .md file and the server adjusts accordingly.

Dates must be in this format:

year-month-day (american way smh)
e.g. 06/05/2024 = 2024-05-06

Otherwise ordering of posts wont work with the
newest first.
