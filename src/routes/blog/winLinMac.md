## windows
Biggest of all the other OS's - easy to use and has the most features built for it. I have used windows for the majority of my time with computers and find that the OS is very good, especially since that most thing are developed on or with windows as it's such a large majority of the Operating system market share. This means that solving potential issues with windows is almost always solvable with some online resource as there is a high likelihood that someone else has had the same issue before you because such a large number of people are using it. I use it as my main OS because it can run all games.

However, as my time using computers increased and I heard about linux and tired it out - specifically ubuntu & kali linux because they seemed like the best ones to start with. I love the command line in linux, it can be obscure sometimes but there is something about directly typing commands rather than clicking on GUI elements that is satisfying (feels like your interacting with the computer more directly).     This was my main issue in windows because the command line just wasn't the same - this was until WSL & WSL2 came out and since then it has removed the need for running linux bare-metal and as my daily-driver (execpt for my laptop) rather than using the linux terminal & the ease-of-use with windows, not switching OS's when wanting to play games is great.


## Linux

I really like linux because of the terminal - it's a great tool that is very useful. The different operating system's that are created & maintained by different communities is fantastic, the one's that I have the most time with are:
- Ubuntu (best for daily-driving but not as interesting as the others).
- Kali linux (1337 hackerman).
- Parrot OS (1337 hackerman but not as good autocompletion in terminal)

- Arch linux (lots of customisaton & lots to get into but hard learning curve).
  - Garuda linux (runs on arch but very cool & easier to install than arch)

The biggest downside (and main issue for not daily-driving linux) is that it does not have support for Microsoft Office stuff - especially things like Onedrive & Office365 which make it a pain because these are used by lots of institutions and means people have to use windows (owned by Microsoft) for Onedrive which is very annoying but understandable to keep their market share for windows. This wouldn't annoy me too much but the fact that you can use Onedrive & Office365 on Mac - which uses the same terminal (sadly not the same kernel XNU & UNIX), so there is support for it but just not available unless you pay Apple's hefty price for one of their laptops.

## MacOS 
From personaly owning a mac I do understand what is appealing about it because it is very good hardware (not for the money as you are still over-paying lots for things like SSD space & RAM (which is not a lot because you could get more bang-for-buck on other laptops)) the build-quality is exceptional and no other laptop can compare with that and the battery life. Not only is the build-quality & battery life very good but you can also use Microsoft products which makes it perfect for people who use both (which happens to be most people) But all of these benefits come at a high price if you want to use Apple's products.

Windows laptops are soon going to get new snapdragon processors which claim to be better at battery life as well as perfoamnce than the M3 macbooks so that might change and potentially make Apple get more competitive - still a big win for laptops in general.

Anyway, that's it - linux is my personal favourite but I use windows just because it's the best of both worlds, but thing's may change so we'll see what happens later down the line.
