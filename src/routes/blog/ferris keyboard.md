## What is the ferris keyboard?
the ferris keyboard is a minimalistic keyboard that contains only 34 keys for ease-of-use and comfort as the lower number of keys will mean that you don't have to move your fingers more than two keys to reach the one that is desired.

## Creating the ferris keyboard
The process of editing and uploading the file of the PCB is very simple: I would like to give credit to -- dude's name here - for a very good video about the ferris keyboard & how to create one from scratch.

## My keyboard
Because of the extensive documentation about most custom keyboards using QMK the ordering of the PCB & other parts such as the ARRS & keys as well as keycaps was made much easier. I made a mistake when ordering the micro-controllers because I ordered some that did not have u functionality which ment I had to order some new ones in order for the firmware to be flashed and the keyboard to work appropriately.
