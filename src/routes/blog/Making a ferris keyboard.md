## What is the ferris keyboard?
The ferris keyboard is a minimalistic keyboard that contains only 34 keys for ease-of-use and comfort as the lower number of keys will mean that you don't have to move your fingers across as wide of a space (two or more keys) to hit a desired key which can improve the overall experience in typing. However, because of a reduced number of keys the ferris has it need to utilize layers in order to be able to be used an actual keyboard -> buttons like: ctrl, shift, caps-lock, tab, esc....

## Ordering the parts


## Creating the ferris keyboard
The process of editing and uploading the file of the PCB is very simple: I would like to give credit to -- dude's name here - for a very good video about the ferris keyboard & how to create one from scratch.

## My keyboard
Because of the extensive documentation about most custom keyboards using QMK the ordering of the PCB & other parts such as the ARRS & keys as well as keycaps was made much easier. I made a mistake when ordering the micro-controllers because I ordered some that did not have usb functionality which meant I had to order some new ones in order for the firmware to be flashed and the keyboard to work appropriately.
