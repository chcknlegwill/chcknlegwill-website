## Why use the terminal?
The terminal has been used to interact with computers long before GUI's were availible to use. It is a way to directly and explicitly interact with the computer rather than relying on a GUI and can be very unfriendly to the unaquainted.

My first time using any kind of terminal was probably using the old windows 10 terminal to run and load python scripts in secondary school. I enjoyed this a lot as I figured out you can run other commands on the terminal such as netstat which looked very cool at the time as it would display ALL the comptuers on the school's network and their names.

After a while, I started getting more and more into open-source software through discovering platforms like GitHub, this then lead me to try out linux as an operating system. I didnt want to fully commit as I was still unsure about using linux so I went for what I assume most people use today - a Virtual Machine (VM). I went with Ubuntu as that is what most people said online is best for beginers. The installation process is very easy and very simmilar to Windows so it was pretty painless, and the OS was working well. After using the command line for a few things I realised just how powerful and usefull it was - you can do pretty much anything with a computer just using the terminal (other than gui-only things like an excel spreadsheet), and I loved it - the feeling of typing in specific commands that you would only know from experience or knowledge from somewhere else was amazing to see, and a very different experience to using GUI's.

As I contiued to use Linux, I eventually found out about hacking and wanting to be a super cool hackerman, I installed Kali Linux on a VM (very similar to Ubuntu's installation). However, when I opened the terminal, I found that it used a completley different shell and look way cooler:
