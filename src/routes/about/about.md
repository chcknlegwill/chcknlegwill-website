Hello, My name is William. I am the owner of this domain, I used to have a VPS on namecheap but the node & npm versions were at least 5+ behind so I moved to using cloudflare pages in order to host this site which works like a dream, especailly the github integration.


Anyway, I am a computer science university student end enjoying it a lot. I am interested in all aspects of computer science escpecially the security side of things I find reading and learning about malware particularly interesting.
