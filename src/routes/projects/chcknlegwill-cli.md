## What is this tool for?
This cli tool is mainly for me to explore making and maintaining something that can be used to do something else (even if there are much better alternatives out there).

The main usecase for this so far is to search for strings in the current directory as well as subdirectories - the usage is as follows:

``` chcknlegwill-cli -f and ```
